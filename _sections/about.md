The seminar series is open to everyone and aims to bring together researchers, students, and industry practitioners with an interest in mathematics as well as data science. With this activity, we wish to nourish and strengthen the exchange of ideas, foster cross-disciplinary collaboration, and provide inspiration for thesis topics. Each seminar will be given by an invited speaker from academia or industry and is intended for a broad audience. Topics of interest include:

- mathematical, statistical, and computational methods for data science,
- application areas (e.g., solution of a practical data science problem), and
- current problems and open challenges. 

The seminar series is sponsored by the [Danish Data Science Academy](https://ddsa.dk).
